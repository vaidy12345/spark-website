                Spark’s reporting is built to answer one question: “What should I do with my next hour of teaching time?” It shows you which students and which concepts need attention, instead of just showing you vanity graphs.

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">1. Live quiz reports: see the class thinking, not just the final score</h2>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    When you run a quiz in class, Spark shows you a live report as answers come in:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
                    <li>A per‑student view: correct, wrong, skipped, total questions, and time taken.</li>
                    <li>A per‑question view: how many got it right, how many struggled, and which questions are slowing everyone down.</li>
                    <li>A question‑by‑question breakdown you can use immediately to decide what to revisit before moving on.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                    The goal is not to rank your students, but to give you a clear picture of where the group is stuck while there’s still time to fix it.

                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    Today, Spark already captures rich quiz data: which student chose which option, how long each question took, and which chapters each question belongs to. The next step is to give you a simple, longitudinal view per student:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
                    <li>A timeline of quizzes taken, with scores and completion times.</li>
                    <li>A topic‑level view of strengths and weak spots across your subjects.</li>
                    <li>Plain‑language suggestions like “Spend more time on waves” or “Redo the optics quiz from last week”.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                    This isn’t about generating more charts—it’s about giving you and the student a shared, simple picture of how things are changing.
                </p>

                <div
                    class="mt-4 border-2 border-dashed border-emerald-300 rounded-2xl p-4 bg-emerald-50/60"

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">3. Turning data into concrete teaching decisions</h2>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    All of Spark’s reporting is built to feed back into how you run your next class:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
                    <li>Start each session with a short quiz, then use the live report to decide whether to revise or move on.</li>
                    <li>Spot questions nearly everyone got wrong and re‑teach those ideas with new examples.</li>
                    <li>Encourage students to review their attempts and then ask the course tutor about questions they missed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                    Over time, this creates a gentle loop: quiz → see where the class really is → adjust → quiz again. Students feel seen, and you waste less time guessing.
