                Spark is not a weekend side-project. It is the outcome of nearly a decade of building for real teachers and students, being punched in the face by reality, and then trying again.

                    <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                    The journey started with a simple but emotionally loaded problem: helping people stay consistent with their wellness practice. That led to building tools for yoga studios—tracking subscriptions, attendance, payments, and hybrid class logistics across in‑person and online students.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                    That work eventually grew into a dedicated product called

                    an operations backbone for independent teachers and studios, handling recurring classes, workshops, recordings, international payments, country‑wise pricing, and student communication from one place.

                    <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        At one point the focus shifted to helping wellness teachers market themselves: automatically turning long Zoom sessions into short social clips. On paper, it was perfect—teachers simply connected their accounts and received ready‑to‑post reels.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        <li>Zoom recordings were too grainy to represent teachers well on social media.</li>
                        <li>Phone‑based recording didn’t fit how studios actually ran their classes.</li>
                        <li>Many teachers felt overly self‑conscious knowing “the AI” was always watching.</li>
                    </ul>

                        The core insight from this detour: live video is full of gems, but using it purely for marketing wasn’t the right fit for many serious educators.

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">The pivot to dense academic content</h2>
                    <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        The real breakthrough came from looking at a different kind of video: dense academic lectures. Unlike many wellness sessions, these recordings are packed with new ideas, definitions, and worked examples. They are perfect raw material for micro‑learning and AI tutoring.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        Two early academic teachers agreed to an unusual deal: no revenue at first, but open access to thousands of hours of their Zoom lectures. That library became the test bed for what eventually evolved into Spark’s current engine—turning raw lectures into structured courses with chapters, notes, slides, quizzes, and a tutor.

Phase 2: 'AI reels experiment' with icons for vertical video and social media that visually look a bit 'noisy' or crossed out. Phase 3: 'Deep learning engine' with icons for chapters, notes, quizzes, tutor. Add small callouts like '100+ paying users' for Phase 1 and '2000+ hours of academic video' for Phase 3.

                        If you already teach live or record long lessons, you’re sitting on a huge library of explanations, examples, and off‑the‑cuff clarifications that students never see again. Spark’s job is to turn that backlog into something students can actually use: short sections, readable notes, quick tests, and a course‑specific tutor that stays inside your universe.
                    </p>

                        You keep teaching the way you already do. Spark makes that teaching durable, searchable, and sellable.

                        For years, the operations layer behind Spark has been available publicly as
                        <a href="https://practicenow.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline decoration-slate-400 hover:text-brand-600">PracticeNow</a>:
                        plans, subscriptions, payments, virtual studio, secure video, promotions, and reporting for live and recorded classes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
                        Over the coming months, those monetization and operations features will be folded directly into Spark as core capabilities, so teachers and students experience a single, seamless product—from “turn my recordings into courses” all the way to “run and grow my teaching business”.
