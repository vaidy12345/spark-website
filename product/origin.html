                Spark is not a weekend side‑project. It is the latest step in a long, messy journey:
                building for real teachers and students, finding the edges of each idea in the wild,
                and then keeping the learnings while we try again.

            <p class="text-base text-slate-600 mb-10 leading-relaxed">
                Before we ever touched education products, we spent nine years running a small software studio
                called <a href="https://multunus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                class="underline decoration-slate-400 hover:text-brand-600">Multunus</a>—building and maintaining
                other people’s products. That decade taught us how expensive broken systems are, how much
                reliability matters when people depend on your software, and left us with one unresolved itch:
                to stop building only for others and pour that craft into our own product.

                        helping people stay consistent with their wellness practice. That led to an early product
                        called Good Karma, and then to building tools for yoga and wellness teachers—tracking
                        subscriptions, attendance, payments, and hybrid class logistics across in‑person and
                        online students.

                        and student is the center of everything; our software had to quietly support that bond,

                        2022–2024 · Storyteller &amp; AI Reels – when “perfect” AI plans met real classrooms
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text-base text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        After PracticeNow, the next obvious question was: if we already run the operations,
                        can we also help teachers grow faster? First came Storyteller—an attempt to nurture leads
                        with automated WhatsApp sequences built from a teacher’s existing content. On paper, it made
                        sense. In practice, we kept seeing the same pattern: unless the content was genuinely useful
                        and easy to consume, no amount of automation could save it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        So we stepped closer to the content itself. The idea behind our AI reels product sounded
                        almost too good: connect your Zoom account, and we quietly scan your long classes for the
                        best moments—clear explanations, satisfying “aha” reactions, strong audio—and turn them into
                        vertical clips with captions, covers, and ready‑to‑post copy. No editing timelines, no
                        rewriting hooks, no exporting. Just teach the way you already do, and wake up to a stack of
                        reels and shorts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        In demos, it was magic. Teachers saw their own words come back as polished clips and said
                        things like, “You mean I never have to record reels again?” But the moment we tried to live
                        with it in real classes, the cracks showed up fast.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        Zoom recordings looked grainy and flat on social media; more than one teacher told us
                        they would rather post nothing than something that made them look unprofessional. Asking
                        teachers to record a second, phone‑based angle sounded simple; in hybrid studios it turned
                        into a mess of extra tripods, two clip‑on mics, and constant anxiety about which device
                        was actually getting good audio. Even when the hardware cooperated, the upload flow from
                        high‑resolution phones into a browser‑based tool was painful enough that people quietly
                        stopped doing it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        Worst of all, the product changed how some teachers felt while teaching. Knowing that
                        “the AI” was always watching nudged them out of the relaxed, responsive headspace their
                        students loved and into a vague sense of performing for a camera that might or might not
                        behave. On our side, the graphs told the story brutally: excited demos, a few early reels
                        shipped, then usage tapering off to almost nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        We did not walk away thinking “AI for creators doesn’t work.” We walked away thinking
                        we were pointing the AI at the wrong problem. The real magic in those long sessions was
                        not how they would look chopped into a few seconds of social media—it was how much
                        <span class="font-semibold text-slate-900">teaching</span> was packed into them, and how
                        little of that teaching students could reliably reuse.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base text-slate-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                        The algorithms we built to find strong moments in 60–90 minute recordings did not get
                        thrown away. They became the backbone of how Spark now finds chapters and micro‑sections.
                        The painful part was everything we had to admit in order to make that shift.

                        The real breakthrough came when we stopped looking at sessions only as marketing
                        fuel and started looking at them as dense learning material. Lectures, workshops,
                        cohort sessions, long‑form YouTube videos, and internal trainings are all full of
                        new ideas, definitions, frameworks, and worked examples. They are perfect raw
                        material for micro‑learning and tutoring—if you can reshape them.

                        Two early academic teachers agreed to an unusual deal: no revenue at first, but
                        open access to thousands of hours of their Zoom lectures. That library became the
                        test bed for what eventually evolved into Spark’s current engine—turning raw
                        recordings into structured courses with chapters, short sections, notes, slides,
                        quizzes, and a course‑specific tutor that stays inside the teacher’s universe.

                        A single 90‑minute session can turn into a dozen or more short sections. Each can
                        be completed in under ten minutes with notes and a quick check for understanding.
                        Students make progress in small, repeatable steps; teachers get a durable library
                        instead of a pile of forgotten recordings.

                        For teachers who already teach through long‑form video—on Zoom, YouTube, or even
                        folders of recordings on Google Drive—Spark is the first version where everything
                        points directly at learning: micro‑learning, frequent assessment, and a grounded
                        tutor working together. It is the first time teachers told us, “This feels like how
                        I always wanted my students to be able to use my content.”

                        For years, the operations layer behind Spark has been available publicly as
                        <a href="https://practicenow.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                        class="underline decoration-slate-400 hover:text-brand-600">PracticeNow</a>:
                        plans, subscriptions, payments, virtual studio, secure video, promotions, and reporting

                        Over the coming months, those monetization and operations features will be folded
                        directly into Spark as core capabilities. The goal is simple: teachers and students
                        experience a single, seamless product—from “turn my recordings into micro‑courses”
                        all the way to “run and grow my teaching business,” with an upcoming AI tutor that
                        stays firmly grounded in the teacher’s own content.
