                Spark is a production line for serious teaching: it listens once, then quietly does the unglamorous work of structuring, summarizing, questioning, and tutoring—so your students can learn in short, focused sessions.

                            Upload one messy recording and Spark breaks it into a course: high‑level chapters, each made of short 3–8 minute sections. Students don’t have to scrub through a two‑hour wall of video—they can jump directly to the idea they care about.

                            Behind the scenes, Spark pays attention to where ideas start and end in your speech, not just where there happen to be silences. It looks for topic shifts, repeated reminders, and “now let’s move on to…” signals that human teachers use naturally.
