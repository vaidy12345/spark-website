                How Spark keeps the AI on a short leash.
            </h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mb-10">
                If students are going to learn from AI‑generated content, “close enough” is not good enough. Spark is built to stay grounded in your actual lectures, and to raise its hand when it’s unsure instead of bluffing.
            </p>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">1. Study notes that are double‑checked, not free‑styled</h2>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    For each chapter, Spark goes through a two‑step process:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
                    <li>First pass: draft notes based on the relevant part of your lecture.</li>
                    <li>Second pass: a separate check that asks, “Is this scientifically correct?” and “Does this really reflect what the teacher said?”</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    If the second pass is not confident, Spark will try small corrections a few times. If it still can’t resolve the issue, the note is clearly marked for review instead of being quietly shipped as if it were perfect.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                    The system is also on the lookout for broken formulas, strange characters, and other signs that something might confuse your students.
                </p>

            <!-- Quizzes -->
            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">2. Quizzes anchored in real chapters</h2>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    Spark’s quizzes are designed to be answerable from the material your students have actually seen:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
                    <li>Each question is tied to one or more specific chapters, not to vague “topics in the air”.</li>
                    <li>There are checks to make sure the correct answer matches the explanation and is actually supported by the relevant chapter.</li>
                    <li>Questions that don’t clearly belong anywhere, or that can’t be fixed cleanly, are dropped rather than forced in.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                    This reduces the risk of students being quizzed on material you never intended to teach—or answers that sound clever but aren’t grounded in your course.
                </p>

            <!-- Chapters & slides -->
            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">3. Chapters and slides that match what’s actually on screen</h2>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    Spark doesn’t just trust the first guess about where chapters begin and end. It cross‑checks suggested boundaries against the real transcript, and if something looks out of order, it runs a dedicated fix‑up step instead of silently slicing the video in the wrong place.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    The same spirit applies to slides and key frames: visual duplicates are detected and removed, and if Spark can’t find any usable slides for a chapter, it surfaces that as a visible issue rather than pretending everything is fine.
                </p>

                <div

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">4. A tutor that knows its place</h2>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    The course tutor is intentionally narrow‑minded: it answers from your course, not from the open internet. Every reply is based on notes and chapters that were indexed beforehand, and those same snippets are surfaced back to the student as gentle references.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    If a question falls completely outside the course, the tutor is encouraged to say so and redirect the student, instead of inventing an answer just to be helpful.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                    The end result is a tool you can trust to be an extension of your teaching style, not a separate voice with its own agenda.
