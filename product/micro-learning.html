                Your students are learning in the middle of everything else: notifications, family, work, and a never‑ending feed of “just one more video”. Micro-learning is how serious courses stay visible in that noise—and Spark is built around it.
            </p>

            <!-- 1. The attention problem today -->
            <section class="mb-14">
                <div class="flex items-start justify-between gap-8 flex-col lg:flex-row">

                            1. The attention problem your students are actually facing

                            Even highly motivated learners are fighting three things at once:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
                            <li>Short attention spans trained by feeds and shorts.</li>
                            <li>Constant multi‑tasking—studying between pings, calls, and errands.</li>
                            <li>An overload of “great content” competing for the same hours.</li>

                        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                            The result: they <em>intend</em> to watch your full 90‑minute session, but actually squeeze in learning in small pockets—on the bus, between calls, or late at night.

                            Micro-learning doesn’t mean dumbing things down. It means reshaping a long explanation into steps that fit into real days:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
                            <li>Short 5–10 minute units that feel finishable—even when life is busy.</li>
                            <li>Clear entry and exit points so students don’t feel guilty stopping.</li>
                            <li>Frequent checkpoints so they know what “done for today” looks like.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
                            When done well, micro-learning increases the number of “small wins” a student experiences, which keeps them coming back long enough to tackle genuinely hard material.

                            <li>It adds short quizzes that sit next to each chunk, not just at the end of a long video.</li>
                            <li>It gives students a course-specific tutor they can ask about one small step at a time.</li>
