                                Vaidy has been building products for teachers and students since 2017. Before Spark, he ran Multunus, a software consulting studio, for nine years. The company grew to 25 people and served clients across the globe.

                            <p class="text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                The journey to Spark started with PracticeNow - an operations backbone for independent teachers that now processes over $1M+ in payments annually and serves 5,000+ users across 80+ countries. Through PracticeNow, Vaidy learned that removing real friction lets teachers trust you with the core of their business.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                But the bigger insight came from watching hundreds of hours of teaching recordings: the real value is in how much teaching is packed into long sessions - and how little of that teaching students can reliably reuse once the live moment is over.
                            </p>

                                Spark is what happens when you spend years watching your "perfect" ideas meet reality, get humbled, pivot to different markets, and then choose to keep the hard-won lessons and try again. Spark is building toward unlimited 1-on-1 tutoring at scale - because that's what great teaching deserves.

                                Leena is the technical force behind Spark and PracticeNow. As CTO, she's architected systems that process millions in payments, handle thousands of concurrent users, and keep teacher and student data secure across 80+ countries.

                                With deep expertise in software engineering and continuous delivery, Leena has spoken at conferences worldwide about building reliable systems that scale. Her technical vision ensures Spark stays grounded in reality while pushing toward ambitious goals.

                                Janaki's support for PracticeNow is legendary. For years, she's been the first person teachers reach out to when they need help - and the last person they need to talk to. Her support isn't just helpful; it's transformational.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                PracticeNow customers consistently mention Janaki when they talk about what makes the product work. As one teacher put it: "The team at PracticeNow actually cares and listens. Suggestions are actually heard. This makes a world of difference."
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                That same care and attention to detail is now coming to Spark. Janaki understands that building trust with teachers isn't about perfect software - it's about being there when things go wrong, listening when teachers have ideas, and caring enough to make their workflows actually work.
                            </p>

                                Her approach to support reflects our broader philosophy: tools should quietly support great teaching, not become another thing teachers have to manage.
