                <p>
                    We believe that teaching is an art, but course production is a grind. 
                    Great teachers shouldn't have to become video editors, technical writers, or web developers just to share their knowledge online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spark was built to be invisible. We don't want to be the center of attention. 
                    We want to be the quiet infrastructure that absorbs the tedious work of creating a course, so you can focus on the human connection with your students.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Spark isn't a venture-backed experiment. It's built by the team behind <strong>PracticeNow</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For over 5 years, we've run the infrastructure for 120+ teachers and 5,000+ students, processing over $1M+ in payments annually. 
                    We built Spark because we saw our own teachers struggling with the "content gap"—they had hours of amazing Zoom lectures, but no time to turn them into structured courses.
                </p>
