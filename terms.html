            <h2>6. AI Services and Limitations</h2>
            
            <h3>6.1 How AI Services Work</h3>
            <p>Spark uses artificial intelligence to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Transcribe audio and video content</li>
                <li>Identify chapters and logical section breaks</li>
                <li>Generate study notes from your teaching</li>
                <li>Create quiz questions based on course content</li>
                <li>Power an AI tutor that answers student questions using your course materials</li>
                <li>Extract slides and key frames from videos</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6.2 "As-Is" Basis for AI-Generated Content</h3>
            <p>AI-generated content is provided <strong>"AS IS"</strong> without warranties of any kind. Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> AI-generated notes, quizzes, and tutor responses may contain errors, inaccuracies, or misinterpretations</li>
                <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> AI may miss important concepts or fail to capture nuances in your teaching</li>
                <li><strong>Appropriateness:</strong> Generated content may not always match the tone, level, or context you intended</li>
                <li><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> The AI tutor may occasionally generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information not present in your course</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6.3 Teacher Responsibility to Review</h3>
            <p>As a Teacher, you are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reviewing</strong> all AI-generated content before publishing to students</li>
                <li><strong>Editing or regenerating</strong> content that doesn't meet your standards</li>
                <li><strong>Verifying accuracy</strong> of notes, quiz questions, and explanations</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring</strong> AI tutor responses and providing corrections when needed</li>
                <li><strong>Not blindly relying</strong> on AI-generated content without human oversight</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6.4 Grounding and Constraints</h3>
            <p>We design our AI services to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay grounded in your actual course content</li>
                <li>Cite sources when answering student questions</li>
                <li>Acknowledge when information isn't available in the course</li>
                <li>Flag content for review when confidence is low</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, these constraints are not perfect. AI systems can make mistakes, and you remain ultimately responsible for the educational accuracy of your courses.</p>

            <h3>6.5 No Liability for AI Errors</h3>
            <p>We are not liable for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inaccuracies in AI-generated notes, quizzes, or tutor responses</li>
                <li>Student confusion or harm resulting from AI errors</li>
                <li>Educational outcomes affected by AI-generated content quality</li>
                <li>Decisions you or your students make based on AI-generated information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your use of AI Services is at your own risk. Always review and verify AI-generated content.</p>
